# st2

Module to manage [StackStorm](http://stackstorm.com)

## Maintainers

* James Fryman <james@stackstorm.com>
* Patrick Hoolboom <patrick@stackstorm.com>

## Quick Start

For a full installation on a single node, a profile already exists to
get you setup and going with minimal effort. Simply:

```
include ::st2::profile::fullinstall
```

## Configuration

This module aims to provide sane default configurations, but also stay
out of your way in the event you need something more custom. To accomplish
this, this module uses the Roles/Profiles pattern. Included in this module
are several modules that come with sane defaults that you can use directly
or use to compose your own site-specific profile for StackStorm installation.

Configuration can be done directly via code composition, or set via
Hiera data bindings. A few notable parameters to take note of:

* `st2::version` - Version of ST2 to install. (Latest version w/o value)
* `st2::release` - Release of ST2 to install (Latest version w/o value)

All other classes are documented with Puppetdoc. Please refer to specific
classes for use and configuration.
